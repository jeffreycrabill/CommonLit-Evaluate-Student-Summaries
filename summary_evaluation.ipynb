A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades. These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on to gain employment in the government.

They were in charge of getting the slaves, farmers, and peasants to build palaces or the famous ancient pyramids. More skilled hardworking workers had occupations of craftsmen or women and physicians. This would mostly make up the middle-class people.
